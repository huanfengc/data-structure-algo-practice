## Problems on Data Structures and Algorithms

This repository contains selected problems from LeetCode. They are used for learning and practising various data structures and algorithms.

Each problem is solved in a couple of different ways among which the time and space complexities are analysed. Without any doubt, most of the solutions (if not 100%) have been worked out (for long) by the active community and shared in various forums or videos online. I am grateful for learning and getting inspiration from all these resources.
