    "\n",
    "You are given an integer array ```ribbons```, where ```ribbons[i]``` represents the length of the ```ith``` ribbon, and an integer ```k```. You may cut any of the ribbons into any number of segments of positive integer lengths, or perform no cuts at all.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if you have a ribbon of length ```4```, you can:\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Keep the ribbon of length ```4```,\n",
    "    * Cut it into one ribbon of length ```3``` and one ribbon of length ```1```,\n",
    "    * Cut it into two ribbons of length ```2```,\n",
    "    * Cut it into one ribbon of length ```2``` and two ribbons of length ```1```, or\n",
    "    * Cut it into four ribbons of length ```1```.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your goal is to obtain ```k``` ribbons of all the same positive integer length. You are allowed to throw away any excess ribbon as a result of cutting.\n",
    "\n",
    "Return the maximum possible positive integer length that you can obtain ```k``` ribbons of, or ```0``` if you cannot obtain ```k``` ribbons of the same length.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Constraints:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* ```1 <= ribbons.length <= 10^5```\n",
    "* ```1 <= ribbons[i] <= 10^5```\n",
    "* ```1 <= k <= 10^9```"
