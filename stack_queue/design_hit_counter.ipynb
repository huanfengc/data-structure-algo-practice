    "## Design Hit Counter [problem](https://leetcode.com/problems/design-hit-counter/)\n",
    "\n",
    "Design a hit counter which counts the number of hits received in the past ```5``` minutes (i.e., the past ```300``` seconds).\n",
    "\n",
    "Your system should accept a ```timestamp``` parameter (in seconds granularity), and you may assume that calls are being made to the system in chronological order (i.e., ```timestamp``` is monotonically increasing). Several hits may arrive roughly at the same time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Implement the HitCounter class:\n",
    "\n",
    "* ```HitCounter()``` Initializes the object of the hit counter system.\n",
    "* ```void hit(int timestamp)``` Records a hit that happened at ```timestamp``` (in seconds). Several hits may happen at the same ```timestamp```.\n",
    "* ```int getHits(int timestamp)``` Returns the number of hits in the past 5 minutes from ```timestamp``` (i.e., the past 300 seconds).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Constraints:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* ```1 <= timestamp <= 2 * 109```\n",
    "* All the calls are being made to the system in chronological order (i.e., ```timestamp``` is monotonically increasing).\n",
    "* At most ```300``` calls will be made to ```hit``` and ```getHits```.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Follow up:** What if the number of hits per second could be huge? Does your design scale?"
