    "## Implement Queue Using Stacks [problem](https://leetcode.com/problems/implement-queue-using-stacks/)\n",
    "\n",
    "Implement a first in first out (FIFO) queue using only two stacks. The implemented queue should support all the functions of a normal queue (push, peek, pop, and empty).\n",
    "\n",
    "Implement the MyQueue class:\n",
    "\n",
    "* void push(int x) Pushes element x to the back of the queue.\n",
    "* int pop() Removes the element from the front of the queue and returns it.\n",
    "* int peek() Returns the element at the front of the queue.\n",
    "* boolean empty() Returns true if the queue is empty, false otherwise.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notes:\n",
    "\n",
    "* You must use only standard operations of a stack, which means only push to top, peek/pop from top, size, and is empty operations are valid.\n",
    "* Depending on your language, the stack may not be supported natively. You may simulate a stack using a list or deque (double-ended queue) as long as you use only a stack's standard operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Constraints:\n",
    "\n",
    "* 1 <= x <= 9\n",
    "* At most 100 calls will be made to push, pop, peek, and empty.\n",
    "* All the calls to pop and peek are valid.\n",
    "\n",
    "Follow-up: Can you implement the queue such that each operation is amortized O(1) time complexity? In other words, performing n operations will take overall O(n) time even if one of those operations may take longer."
